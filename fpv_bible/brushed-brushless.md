# Brushed vs. Brushless Motors

Brushed motors are for toys, Brushless motors are for serious machines.

Both brushed and brushless DC motors use electromagnetism to spin. Brushed motors have copper windings and carbon brushes to generate force. In a brushless motor, you lose the brushes while gaining an electronic controller. Magnets in the bell surround a copper-wound stator. Brushless motors create much more torque and are much longer lasting than brushed.

> Brushless motors are typically 85-90% efficient whereas brushed DC motors are around 75-80% efficient. This difference in efficiency means that more of the total power used by the motor is being turned into rotational force and less is being lost as heat.
