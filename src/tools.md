### Soldering Iron


### Solder

Kester 0.80mm (0.31") Rosin Core is Clutzz's solder of choice.


### Double-Sided Tape

Or VHB (Very-High Bond)


### Hex Wrench

2.0mm Hex screws are the most common size used to build Miniquads, however 2.5mm size is prominent and smaller quads (usually 3" propellor; 110-150mm) often use 1.5mm screws. It's best to have all three sizes of wrench, multitools come in handy for this.
